The program will translate a sentence captured as user input.
We first read the in text file textese.txt.
Then from the text file, we create a list of strings from each line
in the text file.
Then we create a dictionary off the list. 
Once the text file has been read into memeory, we close the file. 

We then define a fuction for translating which involves splitting the user
input (sentence) into an array of strings ("enjoy the excellent band tonight") 
["enjoy. "the", "excellent", "band", "tonight"]

Once we have the array of strings representing the user's input sentence, we 
loop through each words to find the key mathcing the word and returns back the 
value assigned to each key word in the dictionary.

After each word is translated, we then
Print out the translated sentence to the user.
